# Flexbox

This was a task that I did while I was attending a Flexbox course at <a href="https://www.alura.com.br/">Alura</a>

The html file and the css style were provided, but without the arrangement of the elements.

The objective of this exercise was to make the site responsive, using flexboxes, as the two layouts presented in the layout folder:

## Desktop Layout:

<img src="layouts/alurinha-layout-desktop.png">

## Mobile Layout:

<img src="layouts/alurinha-layout-mobile.png">

## Coding

The implementation of the flexboxes was made in the /css/flexbox.css file.

Some minor changes were made in the /css/style.css file due to some conflicts that were breaking the layout.
